# Linux

## üéàLinux is a kernel.

**kernel** :- is a code/ program that used to meet your software and      hardware. and allocate some resources.

## üïìHistory of Linux

- In 1969, a team led by computer scientists **Ken Thompson** and **Dennis Ritchie** created the first version of **UNIX** on a PDP-7 minicomputer
    - but it wasn't cheap and open source
- **LINUS TORVALDS** Created the **Linux kernel.** 
    - And posted it online to make it open-source.
    - he used C- programming language.

 ==operating system= kernel + software==

- in 1983, **Richard Stallman** announced the **GNU project** and cofounded the Free Software Foundation in 1985.
      - GNU is a free software replacement to the UNIX OS, But it was just software replacement not full OS {Examples: Bash, tar, emacs‚Ä¶}
- So **GNU + LINUX** will give the ==**GNU/Linux OS==.** 
- *The GNU Linux project was started to create a* *Unix-like operating system created with source code that could be copied, modified, and redistributed*


## üìåShell

- users communicate with the kernel by the **shell
- The Shell is a Command Line Interpreter. It translates commands entered by the user and converts them into a language that is understood by the Kernel.

### ‚ú®Types of shells
 - Based on their **features** there are money shells. 
      - SH 
      - BASH 
      - ZSH 
      - FISH
- TO IDENTIFY YOUR SHELL ‚Äúecho $SHELL‚Äù
>They differ in Coloring, Piping, command compilation, some kind of features. 


üìç Shell :- *Terminal* for Linux
       - *cmd/power shell* for windows


## üìåOperating System

- The main software part of computer that helps to work on.
- It contains: 
     - Kernel - Linux, windows(but not free)
     - Softwares - GNU project
     - Desktop environment 
        - Types of desktop environment on Linux
             - Mate - 
             - Gnome - need high processor.
             - KDE plasma - 
             - XFCE - 
         - Which Desktop environment is best? 
            - Speed depends on: 
                -Animations 
                -High Graphics 
                -Quality
     - File extensions 
        -  a file extension is a suffix added to the end of a file name, typically separated by a period. It indicates the file's type or format and helps the operating system and applications recognize and handle the file correctly. File extensions are used to associate files with specific programs and determine how they should be opened or interpreted.
     - Window manager
        -  a window manager is a program that controls how windows appear and behave in a graphical user interface. It handles tasks such as window placement, resizing, decorations, and input handling.


## ‚ö°why Linux??
-  Fast :- No high speed computer/device needed.
-  Most used :- 
      - 47% of professional developers use Linux-based operating systems.
      - Linux powers 39.2% of websites whose operating system is known. 
      - Linux powers 85% of smartphones. (Hayden James) 
      - Linux, the third most popular desktop OS, has a market share of 2.09%. 
      - The Linux market size worldwide will reach $15.64 billion by 2027. 
      - The world‚Äôs top 500 fastest supercomputers all run on Linux.
      - 96.3% of the top one million web servers are running Linux. 
      - Today, there are over 600 active Linux distros.
- Most hacking tools
- Most secured :- because Linux is open source.
             -but windows is not open source so providers (managers) can get access.


## ‚õì Linux distributions/distro

- distro is modified Linux kernels, type of operation systems with different configurations, software packages, and user experiences tailored to meet specific needs and preferences

- So many distros :-
    -  Debian 
        - Kali Linux :- 
            - is a Debian-derived Linux distribution designed for **digital forensics and penetration testing**. It is maintained and funded by Offensive Security.
            - Desktop Env't : **XFCE**
            - Package manager: **apt**
            - Shell: **ZSH**
        - Ubuntu 
        - Parrot :- 
             - Parrot OS is a Linux distribution based on Debian with a **focus on security, privacy, and development.**
             - Desktop Env't : **mate** 
             - Package manager: **apt** 
             - shell: **bash**
    - Arch 
        - Black arch 
        - Garuda :- 
            - Garuda Linux is a Linux distribution based on the Arch Linux operating system.
            - - Desktop Env't: **KDE plasma** 
            - Package Manager: **pacman** 
            - shell: **fish**
    - Fedora 
    - Red Hat 
    - Gentoo 
    - Android
- Which is best for hackers? 
    - Kali Linux 
    - Parrot OS
    - Garuda 
    - Black Arch

### üîéDo windows have distros?  
- Windows is not open-source so peoples won‚Äôt use / edit it, so there won‚Äôt be other kind. 
- It just give updates and adds some feature on it.
- Desktop Env't:  
- Package manager: Microsoft store
- shell: cmd/power shell


### üìéHow can we use it?
there are many options

1. Main OS/ Main-boot :- completely change the operating system into Linux. for low processor
2. Dual Boot / 2in1 :- use one operating system per on. based on user choice.
3. Live boot :-using flash
4. Cloud terminals :- website that provide shell. for low processor
      - ==URL: https://www.webminal.org==
5. Virtual Machine :-  one computer act as two or more computer. used for medium or high processor
     - Computers have a Technology called **‚ÄúVIRTUALIZATION‚Äù**.  this must be on/ enabled.
     - This is the method how it allocate our using memory to the virtual machines/ VM‚Äôs. 
     - This is a method to use windows and linux together.
     - Softwares that gives you this ability: 
        - HyberV 
        - QEMU 
        - Virtual Box - Oracle 
        - VMware
6. WSL v2 :- Windows Subsystem for Linux. it **gives Linux terminal on windows**. for low processor.  distros like ubuntu or kali
7. Termux - Android
