# ✔Git & Github  
- **Git** is a version control system or tool. 
      Simply, a system to manage your files. 
      Saves the file locally or remote server (github/gitlab) 
      Made by the *linux development community* .

- **GitHub**  is a Web site/server which your git is hosted on. 
     Your files will be saved in folder called *“REPOSITORY”* .

# ✔Introduction to Ethical Hacking

- **Hacking** is referred to exploiting(*use or manipulate to one's advantage*) system **vulnerabilities**(*weak points*) and compromising security controls to gain unauthorized access to the system.
- **Ethical hacking** ==finds== the weak points or loopholes in a computer, web application, or network and ==reports== them to the organization
- The person **who do the hacking** is called ==“HACKER”==

### ✨Types of hackers based on **Ethics**

1. BLACK HAT hackers 
     - The most evil and bad Peoples
2. White HAT hackers  
     - The helping and Good Peoples
3. Grey HAT hackers
    - The middle mans , Good sometimes bad thinking Peoples

### ✨Types of hackers based on **Skill**

1. Newbie / Noob 
      - Don’t have any knowledge about hacking.
2. Script Kiddie (skiddie, kiddie, or skid) 
      - Relatively unskilled individual who uses scripts or programs developed by others, primarily for malicious purposes 
3. Hacker 
     - Perfectly skilled, with less experience
4. Elite/Pro Hacker 
     - Perfectly skilled, with Much more experience


#### 😎Why do we learn hacking??

1. To prevent hackers from gaining access.
2. To uncover vulnerabilities.
3. To strengthen the organization.
4. To safeguard the data.
5. To avoid security breaches.
6. To enhance security awareness.
7. To make money.


#### 🤔 How & Why hack happens??

- Attacks = Motive(Goal) + Method + Vulnerability
        - **attack without vulnerability is just physical attack**
- Motives :- information theft, manipulation data, financial loss, revenge, ransom, damaging reputation. 


### ✨Elements of Information security

These elements help protect information assets from unauthorized access, modification, disclosure, destruction, and disruption. They work together to safeguard information assets and maintain the security of systems and data.

**CIA** triad
- **C - Confidentiality** :- the state of being secret.
                  - the information is safe from accidental or international disclosure.              
- **I - Integrity** :- moral soundness.
            - the information is safe from accidental or intentional modification or alteration.
- **A - Availability** :- handiness or accessibility.
               -  the information is available to authorized users when needed.


### ✨Phases of Hacking

1. Reconnaissance - the act of scouting or exploring
2. Scanning
3. Gaining access
4. Maintaining access 
5. Clearing tracks or logs


## 👀Penetration Testing

- a method of evaluating the security of an information system or network by simulation an attack to it.
      -  find vulnerability
      - security measures  
      - documentation and report preparation

#### 🤔Why we need penetration testing?

- Identification of threats - identifying vulnerability
- Security protections and controls -  to recommend
- Assessment of organization's security - to check
- Evaluation of network security - to check
- upgradation of infrastructure - to recommend
