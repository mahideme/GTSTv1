# ✔Introduction to Ethical Hacking

- **Hacking** is referred to exploiting(*use or manipulate to one's advantage*) system **vulnerabilities**(*weak points*) and compromising security controls to gain unauthorized access to the system.
- **Ethical hacking** ==finds== the weak points or loopholes in a computer, web application, or network and ==reports== them to the organization
- The person **who do the hacking** is called ==“HACKER”==

### ✨Types of hackers based on **Ethics**

1. BLACK HAT hackers 
     - The most evil and bad Peoples
2. White HAT hackers  
     - The helping and Good Peoples
3. Grey HAT hackers
    - The middle mans , Good sometimes bad thinking Peoples

### ✨Types of hackers based on **Skill**

1. Newbie / Noob 
      - Don’t have any knowledge about hacking.
2. Script Kiddie (skiddie, kiddie, or skid) 
      - Relatively unskilled individual who uses scripts or programs developed by others, primarily for malicious purposes 
3. Hacker 
     - Perfectly skilled, with less experience
4. Elite/Pro Hacker 
     - Perfectly skilled, with Much more experience


#### 😎Why do we learn hacking??

1. To prevent hackers from gaining access.
2. To uncover vulnerabilities.
3. To strengthen the organization.
4. To safeguard the data.
5. To avoid security breaches.
6. To enhance security awareness.
7. To make money.


#### 🤔 How & Why hack happens??

- Attacks = Motive(Goal) + Method + Vulnerability
        - **attack without vulnerability is just physical attack**
- Motives :- information theft, manipulation data, financial loss, revenge, ransom, damaging reputation. 


### ✨Elements of Information security

These elements help protect information assets from unauthorized access, modification, disclosure, destruction, and disruption. They work together to safeguard information assets and maintain the security of systems and data.

**CIA** triad
- **C - Confidentiality** :- the state of being secret.
                  - the information is safe from accidental or international disclosure.              
- **I - Integrity** :- moral soundness.
            - the information is safe from accidental or intentional modification or alteration.
- **A - Availability** :- handiness or accessibility.
               -  the information is available to authorized users when needed.


### ✨Phases of Hacking
when we test some system we have to pass this phases

1. Reconnaissance - the act of scouting or exploring
2. Scanning - finding for vulnerability(weakness)
3. Gaining access -
4. Maintaining access - post exploitations, 
5. Clearing tracks or logs


## 👀Penetration Testing

- a method of evaluating the security of an information system or network by simulation an attack to it.
      -  find vulnerability
      - security measures  
      - documentation and report preparation

#### 🤔Why we need penetration testing?

- Identification of threats - identifying vulnerability
- Security protections and controls -  to recommend
- Assessment of organization's security - to check
- Evaluation of network security - to check
- upgradation of infrastructure - to recommend


### ✨Types of Pentesting

1. Black box pentesting
    - testing system **without prior knowledge**.
    - you test as an **attacker**.
2. White box pentesting
    - testing system **with prior knowledge**.
    - you test as a **developer.
3. Grey box pentesting
    - testing system **with limited knowledge**. 
    - you test as a **user**. 


## 📌Terms

 **Red Team**
     - these peoples are offensive, and trying to attack and trying to gain access, then report the way they got in.
**Blue Team**
      - they are the defensive peoples, who will do firewalls and try to protect you.
**Vulnerability Assessment**
       - these are peoples, who do some security check based on some list.
**Security Audit**
       -  a comprehensive evaluation of an organization's security controls, policies, and procedures to ensure compliance with standards and identify areas for improvement.


## 🔥Jobs with Ethical Hacking💰

1. ==Cyber Security Expert==
2. ==Network Security Tester ==
3. Cyber Security Consultant 
4. Web penetration tester 
5. Internal and External Penetration tester
6. Security Analyst 
7.  Bug Hunter


## 😇 Ethics of Cyber Security

- Respect the privacy of others.
- Think before you type. 
- With great power comes great responsibility.
- Always have ==permission==
