# Cryptography? 

- Cryptography is the **science of secret, or hidden writing** 
- **Crypto => Hidden/Secret** | **Graphy => Writing** 
- Used to **secure your data/text**.
- It has two main Components:
      a. **Encryption** 
        - Practice of **hiding messages** so that they **can not be read by anyone other than the intended recipient**
      b. **Authentication & Integrity** 
        -  **Ensuring** that users of data/resources are the persons they claim to be and that **a message has not been altered**


### Encryption Cipher 
encryption--- plain text to cipher(encrypted) text. opposite to decryption
- ==Cipher== is a **method for encrypting messages** 
- Encryption algorithms are standardized & published 
- The ==key== which is an **input to the algorithm** is **secret** 
- ==Key==: is a **string of numbers or characters** 

#### Symmetric Algorithms 
- Algorithms in which **the key for encryption and decryption are the ==same==**  
    Example: **Caesar Cipher** 
-  Types: 
     - **Block Ciphers **
        - Encrypt data **one block at a time** (typically 64 bits, or 128 bits) 
        - **Used for a single message** 
     - **Stream Ciphers**
         - Encrypt data **one bit or one byte at a time** 
         - **Used if data is a constant stream of information**


##### Substitution Ciphers 
###### Caesar Cipher 
Caesar Cipher is a method in which **each letter in the alphabet is rotated by three letters** 
###### Using a key to shift alphabet 
Obtain a key for the algorithm and then shift the alphabets 
  -  For instance if the key is word we will shift all the letters by four and remove the letters w, o, r, & d from the encryption 
  - We have to ensure that the mapping is one-to-one 
  - no single letter in plain text can map to two different letters in cipher text 
  - no single letter in cipher text can map to two different letters in plain text
###### Website: rot13.com 
Replacing the letters by 1 shift we can get different rotations. To do this we can use this website. This encoding is called **rot encoding** 

#### Limitation  for symmetric algorithm 
- Any exposure to the secret key compromises confidentiality of ciphertext 
- A key needs to be delivered to the recipient of the coded message for it to be deciphered 
    - Some intruders can get the key and BOOM! No secret anymore.

4. Change ‚ÄúHello There‚Äù to cipher with a key to alphabet shift of ‚ÄúHACK‚Äù



#### Asymmetric Encryption 
- Uses **a pair of keys** for encryption 
    - **Public key** for encryption 
    - **Private key** for decryption 
- **Messages encoded using public key can only be decoded by the private key** 
    - **Secret transmission of key** for decryption is **not required** 
          - **Public key can be exposed** so, if i need to send you a message i just ask you for your public key and i will encrypt the message with your public key. When you get the ciphertext you can decrypt it with your private key. 
    - Every entity can generate a key pair(private & public) and release its public key

##### Types of asymmetric enc. 
- Two most popular algorithms are RSA & El Gamal , AES, DSA
- RSA 
    - Developed by Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, Len Adelman 
    - Both public and private key are interchangeable 
    - Variable Key Size (512, 1024, or 2048 bits) 
    - Most popular public key algorithm 
    - It have a maths formulas for generating the keys. 
- El Gamal 
    - Developed by Taher ElGamal 
    - Variable key size (512 or 1024 bits) 
    - Less common than RS
###### Applications 
One of example program that use asymmetric encryption is ==SSH==. When you Create/Config SSH on your computer it ==give u 2 keys,== 1 public and 1 private, so when connection is established each hosts exchange their public key and store it in (known_hosts), then anytime they send data they will encrypt them with the public, and the host will decrypt it with its private key. So if your Private Key got leakedüíÄ


### 3 Terms of Cryptography 
1) **Encoding/ decoding** 
     - This is a method of **creating Cipher text with out using any key** 
     - This can be done by doing math on the given input/substitution    
         - Examples: base64,base32,rot‚Ä¶
2) **Encrypting/Decrypting** 
    - This is method of **creating Cipher text with keys**. 
    - To decrypts this kind u need to have the private key 
         - Example: DES,AES,RSA
the above are two way, reversible, (decryptable or decoded)
3) **Hashing** 
one way and irreversible, undecryptable, but cracked or **matched**
    - This is a method of creating Cipher text with respect to a created hash 
    - **To reverse the hash, you just search for some match, you don't decrypt/decode it**. 
    - **Salt:** is a random string used for data modification for password protection, This can be adding some text as prefix/suffix 
        - Example: MD5,sha254,...



#### Kinds of encodings/encryptions 
- Base2 01100010 01110010 01100101 01100001 01101011 01101001 01110100 == breakit

### tools  
- There are lots of encodings/encryption 
- To identify this we will need some tools/sites
- Tools:   
    - ==Cyber chef== -- web
    - ==Tunnelsup== -- web
    - hashid --hash--  on linux

#### decoding/decrypting 
There are so many way to reverse some hashes/ciphers. 
- Hashes 
       - ==Crackstation.net==(non-salted)  
       - Own cracking(google the name) 
 - Encodings 
      - ==CyberChef==


**identifying unknown hashes**
some hashes are not normal hashes they are generated by some Platform/Software. So to Crack this hash. - Identify the Software which the hash Generated with.
- Ex: The Hash can be generated by some Software called Openfire 
- Then Try to Search Some Cracking Scripts made for this has


## Wordlists 
- Wordlists are a normal text file that contains Different Words that can be used to match hashes, or for checking some parameters repeatedly using some loops

#### Custom Wordlists 
- We can Create our own Wordlists, We can Create text file and add our highly usable words or we can use tools like 
    - Cewl
    - Cupp



# Python for cryptography 
- We can use programming to do tools that can do our own encryption and encoding hash type 
- There are so many methods, even you can do the encoding/decodeing for the base64‚Ä¶ 
- You just need to understand the maths. 
- simple XOR‚Äôing example 


- Unicode is a character encoding standard that assigns a unique numerical value, called a code point, to each character or symbol. The Unicode decimal representation refers to expressing these code points as decimal numbers.
- The Unicode decimal representation simply converts these hexadecimal code points to their decimal equivalent.
     - The Unicode code point for the uppercase letter "A" is U+0041 in hexadecimal.
     - The decimal equivalent of U+0041 is 65.
encrypt
- change the message and the key into unicode decimal and then xor it with the key
- after xor change the output to hex data
decrypt
- hex data to unicode for the message --bytes.from hex().decode()
- unicode to message xor with key -- ord
- converts the unicode text into characters -- chr


```python
def encrypt():
    msg=input('message: ')
    key=input('key: ')
    encrypt_hex=''
    key_itr=0
    for i in range(len(msg)):
        deciText=ord(msg[i]) ^ ord(key[key_itr])
        key_itr+=1
        if key_itr >= len(key):
            key_itr = 0
        
        encrypt_hex += hex(deciText)[2:]
        
    print(f'message encrypted successfully!\nmessage: {encrypt_hex}')
    

def decrypt():
    msg=input('message: ')
    key=input('key: ')
    hex2uni= ''
    key_itr=0
    decrypt_text=''
    for i in range(0, len(msg), 2):
        hex2uni+=bytes.fromhex(msg[i:i+2]).decode('utf-8')
        
    for i in range(len(hex2uni)):
        temp=ord(hex2uni[i]) ^ ord(key[key_itr])
        decrypt_text+=chr(temp)
        key_itr+=1
        if key_itr>=len(key):
            key_itr=0
    print(f'the decrypted message is:\n{decrypt_text}')
    
    
print('welcome to mahEncrypter.')
print('=========================')
user=input('what do you want to do \n 1) Encrypt \n 2) Decrypt\n>>')
if user=='1':
    encrypt()
elif user=='2':
    decrypt()
else:
    print('error, no input!')
```


```python
import base64 as b64
msg=input('text: ')
encoded= base64.b64encode(bytes(msg,'utf-8'))
print(encoded)

decoded=base64.b64decode(encoded)
print(decoded)


```



## Obfuscation 
-  In software development, obfuscation is the act of creating source or machine code that is difficult for humans or computers to understand. ‚óè As we know High level programming lang. are easy to understand, so if hackers got your code he can read it, but to make it more difficult we use this technique ‚óè This was the codeni
