# Introduction to Networking

- A computer network consists of **two or more computing devices** ==connected to each other== **to share resources and information.**
- The network becomes a powerful tool when computers communicate and share resources with other computers on the same network or entirely distinct networks.

- **Computers** on a network can **act as** a ==client== or a ==server==. 

    - ==Client== computer 
         - A client is a computer that **requests for resources.**

     - ==Server== computer 
          - A server is a computer that ==controls and provides access to resources==. 
          - But have **higher RAM,CPU and STORAGE**
         - Server Rack            
             - switch
             - modem 
             - servers 
             - firewall
             - display
             - etc
             - ![[Pasted image 20240513235131.png]]

- Need of Networks 
     - Enhance communication. 
     - Share resources. 
     - Facilitate centralized management 
     - Internet


# Classification of Networks 

1. Classification by **network geography**. 

     A. Local area network ==(LAN)== 
        - A LAN **covers a relatively small area** such as a classroom, school, or a single building. 
        - LANs are **inexpensive to install** and also **provide higher speeds**.
     B. Metropolitan area network ==(MAN)==
        -  A MAN **spans** the distance of a typical **metropolitan city**. 
        - The **cost of installation** and **operation** is **higher**.
        - MANs **use high-speed connections** such as **fiber optic**s to achieve higher speeds
     C. Wide area network ==(WAN)== 
         -  WANs **span a larger area than a single city**.
         - These use long distance **telecommunication networks for connection,** thereby increasing the cost. 
         - **The Internet is a good example of a WAN.**

2. Classification by **component roles.**

      A. ==Peer-to-peer== 
           - In a peer-to-peer network, **all computers are considered equal**. 
           - Each computer controls its own information and is capable of functioning as either **a client or a server** depending upon the requirement.
           - Peer-to-peer networks are **cheap** and **easy to install**. 
           - *They are popular as home networks and for use in small companies.* 
           - *Most **operating systems** come with built-in peer-to-peer networking capability*. 
           - The *maximum number of peers* that can operate on a peer-to-peer network is ==ten==.
           - Each peer shares resources and allows others open access to them.

     B. ==Server based== 
          - A server-based network **offers centralized control** and is **designed for secure operations**. 
          - In a server-based network, a dedicated server controls the network. 
          - A **dedicated server** is one that **services the network** by storing data, applications, resources, and also provides access to resources required by the client.

      C. ==Client-based== 
          - Client-based network **servers** **process requests from clients** and **return just the results.** 
          - These networks take advantage of the powerful **processing capabilities of both the client** and the server.


# IP/internet protocol/ address
software address

   - is a network layer protocol.
   - a way to identify machines on a network.
   - a unique identifier.

   - Used to connect to another computer or network. 
   - Allows transfers of files and e-mail 
   - Identify a device

**IP types** 
   - Based On IP versions 
     - IPv4 
     - IPv6

### IPv4 ( Internet protocol version 4)

- An IPv4 address is a ==32-bit== sequence of 1s and 0s. 
- To make the IP address easier to use, the address is usually written as four  decimal numbers separated by periods. 
- This way of writing the address is called the **dotted decimal** format. 
- IP generated by **DHCP or Manually**

#### IP structure 
   - IP addresses consist of four sections  - 192.168.123.12
   - Each section is 8 bits long -  11000000  10101000  01111011  00001100
   - Each section can range from 0 to 255


- When you connect to some network an IP address will be generated and given **automatically by DHCP(like individuals have)** or **static way(for websites like the google have**). 
- Every **IP address** has **two parts**: 
      - **Network**: to identify the network( የእናንተ,የጎረቤት) 
      - **Host**: identify the user(ስልክ,PC) 
- The first(1) host address is called GATEWAY ADDRESS


#### Private and Public IP addresses. 
  - **Any HOST have 2 different IP’s**  
  - **Public IP**: 
      - is an IP address that is **given to the host on the ==WAN== network** 
  - **Private IP**: 
      - is IP that is **given to the host on ==LAN== network. **
      - Internet and intranet?
          - **internet is world wide used**
          - **intranet is local network used in companies** 
              - their own databases, servers, websites
              - here **VPNs** are used for connecting different regions.


  - There are **5 classes of private IP address** A B C D and E
  
      ➔ CLASS A: ==Governments== 
           - have **24bit** of space for **HOSTS**
             - network  **host  host  host**
             - 2^#of zero -- to get no of hosts per network
           - the **first octet address range(network)** is between ==**0-127**==
        
      ➔ CLASS B: ==medium Companies ==
          - have **16bit** of space for **HOSTS**
             - network  network  **host  host**
         - the **first octet address range(network)** is between ==128-191==
        
      ➔ CLASS C: ==small companies== 
          - have **8bit** of space for **HOSTS**
             - network  network  network  **host**
         - the **first octet address range(network)** is between ==192-223==
         - it is used on our home, school and office network
         - devices in same network have same starting number
        
      ➔ CLASS D: Multi-Casting(streaming) 
      
      ➔ CLASS E: Future Use (IETF research)


#### Reserved IP Addresses 
- Certain host addresses are reserved and cannot be assigned to devices on a network.
     a. **Addresses beginning ==127==** are **reserved for ==loopback== and ==internal testing==**
     
     b. An IP address that has **==binary 0s or 0s==** in **all host bit positions** is **reserved for the ==network address==.**
     
     c. An IP address that has ==binary 1 or 255s== **in all host bit positions** is **reserved for the** ==broadcast address==



### IPv6 ( Internet Protocol Version 6) 
- IPv6 is a **==128-bit== alphanumeric long value** that identifies an endpoint devices in IPv6 network. 
- Format of an IPv6 address:  
    - FE80:CD00:0000:0CDE:1257:0000:211E:729C 
        - ALPHA-Numeric 
        - Separated by colon(:) 
        - IP generated automatically. 
- The main difference is the IP-space(host holding) IPv4 holds 32-bit ip address but IPv6 holds 128-bit ip Addresses.

#### Myth and truth 
  - WHY do we need IPv6? 
      - lack of IPV4
  - ISP(internet service provider) and IP’s 
      - IP Address are limited, and Expensive
  - DO Peoples Hack with IP address?
     - static(like servers) and dynamic(like individual)
         - changed when you restart/reset
         - lack of IPV4(poor countries)

to know your computer (private) IP address
   - on windows: " ipconfig"
   - on Linux: "if config" , ip a
to know public ip
   -  search for ip -- "what is my ip"
   - on Linux : "curl ifconfig.me"


# MAC(Media Access Control) Address
physical address
-  It is **Given by A manufacturer of that network adapter.** 
- Network adapter is a hardware device that helps us to have connection ( our wifi adapter or our ethernet port) 
- **flat name space of ==48bits**==
    - Typically written in **six octets in hex**
- It is Alphanumeric, with **2 part** 
     - Organizational Unique Id (OUI)
        - assigned by IEEE registration authority
        - determines the first 24bits of the address
     - Universally Administered Address ( UAA)
         - remainder of the mac address
         - allocated by the manufacturer


# OSI(Open Systems Interconnection) Reference model 
- Back in Days, Different Company Devices can’t Communicate or create network.
- OSI Reference Model - internationally standardized network architecture. 
- Specified in ISO 7498. 
- It is an idea model to show the way of network work 
- Model has 7 layers. 
- It shows How Data transfers between 2 hosts/servers

- Layers 1-4 relate to **communications technology** ( physically). 
- Layers 5-7 relate to **user applications**. 
- The sequence differ when sender and receiver use it



### Layer 7: Application Layer
- Level at which applications access network services. 
    - Represents services that directly support software applications for file transfers, database access, and electronic mail, BROWSERS etc. 
- Your data is **DATA** 
    - PROTOCOLS: HTTP,FTP,SMTP

### Layer 6: Presentation Layer 
- Related to **representation of transmitted data** 
- Translates different data representations from the Application layer into uniform standard format 
- Providing services for secure efficient data transmission 
     - e.g. **data encryption, and data compression**. 
- Your data is DATA 
- PROTOCOLS: SSL

### Layer 5: Session Layer 
- **Allows two applications on different computers to establish, use, and end a session.** 
    - e.g. file transfer, remote login 
- Establishes dialog control 
      - Regulates which side transmits, plus when and how long it transmits.
-  Performs token management and synchronization. 
- Your data is DATA 
- PROTOCOLS: RPC,NETBIOS

### Layer 4: Transport Layer 
- Manages transmission packets 
      - **Repackages long messages when necessary into small packets** for transmission [ sender ] 
      - **Reassembles packets in correct order to get the original message.** [ receiver ] 
- Handles error recognition and recovery. 
    -  Transport layer at receiving acknowledges packet delivery. 
    - Resends missing packets 
- Your data is **SEGMENTS** 
- PROTOCOLS: TCP,UDP


### Layer 3: Network Layer 
- Manages addressing/routing of data within the ip range 
     - Addresses messages and translates logical addresses and names into physical addresses. 
     - **Determines the route from the source to the destination computer**
     - Manages traffic problems, such as switching, routing, and controlling the congestion of data packets. 
- Your data is **PACKETS** 
- PROTOCOLS: ICMP,ARP,NAT,IP


### Layer 2: Data Link Layer 
- Packages raw bits from the Physical layer into frames (logical, structured packets for data). [ receiver ] 
- Provides **reliable transmission of frames** 
    - It waits for an acknowledgment from the receiving computer. 
    - Retransmits frames for which acknowledgement not received 
- Your data is **FRAMES** 
- PROTOCOLS: PPP,NDP,CDP


### Layer 1: Physical Layer 
- Transmits bits from one computer to another 
- Regulates the transmission of a stream of bits over a **physical medium**. 
- Defines how the cable is attached to the network adapter and what transmission technique is used to send data over the cable. Deals with issues like 
    - The definition of 0 and 1, e.g. how many volts represents a 1, and how long a bit lasts? 
    - How many pins a connector has, and what the function of each pin is? 
- Your data is **Bits** 
- PROTOCOLS/DEVICES: RS-449


#### TCP(transmission control protocol) and UDP(user datagram protocol)
tcp
- Reliable 
- Connection-Oriented protocol 
     - Means it establishes a connection between the receiver and sender. 
         - It uses 3 way Hand Shake ( more on Network Hacking ) 
- Used on emails, Chat, watching online videos, simple browsing.

udp
- Connectionless 
- less reliable, but faster and more straightforward. 
- It’s often used in situations where higher speeds are crucial, like in streaming or gaming

# TCP/IP model 
- It is A reference model like the OSI model 
- TCP/IP is the new and most used Model at this time. 
- This model have 4 layers(used to be 5 layer)
- Application,Presentation and session layers are combined together and called APPLICATION 
- Data link layer and physical layer combined and called network access layer

## Firewall 
filter the network based on the rule
- A firewall is a network security device that monitors incoming and outgoing network traffic and decides whether to allow or block specific traffic based on a defined set of security rules. 
- It is Just A collection of rules to allow and deny network traffics 
- Ex: You can’t directly access some host directly from other Network
